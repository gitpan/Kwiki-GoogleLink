NAME
    Kwiki::GoogleLink - GoogleLink preformatted text

SYNOPSIS
     $ cpan Kwiki::GoogleLink
     $ cd /path/to/kwiki
     $ echo "Kwiki::GoogleLink" >> plugins
     $ kwiki -update

DESCRIPTION
   This was written as a demonstration of a plugin to add a
   new WAFL phrase to the Kwiki formatting rules.

   This plugin makes it quick and easy to add a Google search
   link to a Kwiki page, for example:

       Search Google for: {google:Kwiki}

   will be rendered as

       Search Google for: 
       <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Kwiki">Kwiki</a>

   This example can be used as the basis for custom shortcuts
   at your own site.
